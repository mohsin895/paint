                    <ol>
                        <li>With the following information we would like to inform you about the content of our
                            newsletter as well as the registration procedure, dispatch procedure and statistical
                            evaluation procedure and your rights to object. By subscribing to our newsletter you agree
                            to its receipt and to the procedure described.</li>
                        <li>Content of the newsletter: We will only send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic
                            notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter "newsletters") with the
                            consent of the recipients or legal permission. If the content of a newsletter is
                            specifically described within the scope of the registration for the newsletter, this is
                            decisive for the consent of the users. In addition, our newsletters contain information
                            about our products, offers, promotions and our company.</li>
                        <li>Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double
                            opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you
                            to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can log in with
                            unknown e-mail addresses. Newsletter registrations are logged to prove that the registration
                            process is in compliance with legal requirements. This includes the storage of the time of
                            registration and time of confirmation as well as the IP address. The changes to your data
                            stored with the dispatch service provider are also logged.</li>
                        <li>Dispatch service provider: The newsletter is dispatched by CleverReach GmbH &amp; Co. KG,
                            Mühlenstr. 43, 26180 Rastede, Germany, hereinafter referred to as "dispatch service
                            provider". The privacy policy of the dispatch service provider can be found here:&nbsp;<a
                                href="http://www.cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/"
                                title="cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window"
                                rel="noreferrer">cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/</a>.</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, the dispatch service provider can use these data in pseudonymous form, i.e. no
                            assignment to a user, in accordance with its own information to optimize or improve its own
                            services, for example to technically optimize the dispatch and display of the newsletter or
                            for statistical purposes in order to determine which countries the recipients come from.
                            However, the dispatch service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to
                            write to them itself or pass these data on to third parties.</li>
                        <li>Registration data: To subscribe to the newsletter, all you have to provide is your e-mail
                            address. As an option, we ask you to provide a name so that we can address you by name in
                            the newsletter.</li>
                        <li>Measuring success: Newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", which is a pixel-sized file
                            that is retrieved from the server of the dispatch service provider when the newsletter is
                            opened. During this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser
                            and your system as well as your IP address and time of retrieval, is collected initially.
                            This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or
                            the target groups and their reading behavior using their retrieval locations (which can be
                            determined using the IP address) or access times. The statistical surveys also include
                            determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are
                            clicked on. Although this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter
                            recipients for technical reasons, neither we nor the dispatch service provider intend to
                            observe individual users. Rather, the evaluations enable us to recognize the reading habits
                            of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content in line with our
                            users’ interests.</li>
                        <li>The dispatch of the newsletter and success measurement are carried out on the basis of
                            recipient consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a, Art. 7 GDPR in conjunction with Section 7 Para.
                            2 No. 3 German Unfair Competition Act (UWG) or on the basis of the legal permission pursuant
                            to Section 7 Para. 3 UWG.</li>
                        <li>The logging of the registration procedure takes place on the basis of our legitimate
                            interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) f GDPR and serves as proof of consent to receive the
                            newsletter.</li>
                        <li>Cancellation/withdrawal: You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.
                            withdraw your consent. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each
                            newsletter. If users have only subscribed to the newsletter and canceled their subscription,
                            their personal data will be erased. <br>&nbsp;</li>

                            economic operation of our online offer as defined by Art. 6 (1) f GDPR), we use content or
                            services from third parties within our online offers to integrate their content and
                            services, e.g. videos or fonts (hereafter referred to as "content"). This always presupposes
                            that the third-party providers of this content are aware of the IP address of the user, as
                            they cannot send content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is thus
                            necessary to display this content. We endeavor to use only such content whose provider uses
                            the IP address only to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called
                            "pixel tags" (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing
                            purposes. Pixel tags can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the
                            pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the
                            user’s device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system,
                            referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer
                            and may be linked to such information from other sources. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
